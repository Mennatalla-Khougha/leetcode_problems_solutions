# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

### Problem

You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.

### Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3

Output: true

### Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false

## Solution

Flatten the matrix into a 1D array 

Defining 2 pointer left and right to define the range to search in the array

A loop with the condition that left pointer is always less than or equal the right pointer

- Calculating the middle pointer 

- Check if the value in the middle pointer = target if so return True

- Check if value in the middle pointer < target that way can eliminate all the value before the middle pointer and the new left pointer will be (middle + 1)

- Check if value in the middle pointer > target that way can eliminate all the value after the middle pointer and the new right pointer will be (middle - 1)

If the loop ended and didn't return anything the target is not in the array and we return False

## Technique

Binary search

## Time Complexity

O(log(m * n))
