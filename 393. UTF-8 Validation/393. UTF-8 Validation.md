# 393. UTF-8 Validation

### Problem

Given an integer array data representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### Example 1:

Input: data = [197,130,1]

Output: true

### Example 2:

Input: data = [235,140,4]

Output: false

## Solution

Start with a zero number of bytes then loop through the array with the following conditions:

If the number of bytes is zero then check the last binary digit if it zero so it's 1- byte character or n-bytes character, the first n bits are all one's, the n + 1 bit is 0, followed by n - 1 bytes and adjust the number of bytes accordingly

If the number of bytes is n't zero then check if the most significant 2 bits being 10 in this case decrement number of bytes by one else return false.

After the loop end return true of number of bytes equal zero else return False

## Time Complexity

O(n)
