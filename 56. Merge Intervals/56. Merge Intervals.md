# 56. Merge Intervals

### Problem

Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

### Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]

Output: [[1,5]]

### Solution

- Define a function to check if 2 lists are overlapping

- Define a function to check to merge 2 overlapping lists

- Sort the original array based on the stating point of the array

- Create a merge array and store the first list in it

- looping through the array lists and checking if each two neighboring lists are intervals if that the case merge them and change the last element in the merge array to the merged list if not add the first list to the merge array

- Return the merge array

### Time Complexity

O(n log(n))
