# 78. Subsets

### Problem

Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicates, return all possible 
subsets


The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]

#### Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]

## Solution

Sort the nums elements so all duplicate elements all next to each other

Defining a backtracking function to generate all possible unique subsets.

- It checks if the index is bigger than the length of the nums array if that is the case it append a copy of all the subsets into the result

- There is a route where we add all subsets even including duplicate elements

- a loop to pass all the duplicate elements after it we call the backtrack function with the next non duplicate elements

Start the backtrack function

Return the result
