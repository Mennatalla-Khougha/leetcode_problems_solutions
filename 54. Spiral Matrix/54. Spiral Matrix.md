# 54. Spiral Matrix

### Problem

Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

### Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]

Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

## Solution:

Using 4 pointer and a while loop to iterate through the matrix in a spiral order. In each iteration, the code processes one row or column of the matrix, and it continues until the entire matrix is traversed.

## Time Complexity

O(m * n)
