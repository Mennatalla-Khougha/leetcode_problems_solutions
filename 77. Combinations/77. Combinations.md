# 77. Combinations

### Problem

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

 

#### Example 1:

Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]

#### Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]

## Solution

Defining a backtracking function to do generate all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

- It checks if the length of the combination = k if that is the case it append that combination to the result as a valid combination

- It loops from the start of the range to n appending the elements to the combination then calling the backtrack function with the new start and combination then remove the last element from the comb  

Start the backtrack function

Return the result
