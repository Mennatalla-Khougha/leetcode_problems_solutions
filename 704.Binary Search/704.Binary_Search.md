# 704. Binary Search

### problem 

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9

Output: 4


### Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2

Output: -1

## solution

Defining 2 pointer start and end to define the range to search in the array

A loop with the condition that start pointer is always less than or equal the end pointer

- Calculating the middle pointer 

- Check if the value in the middle pointer = target if that the case we found the index we are looking for

- Check if value in the middle pointer < target that way can eliminate all the value before the middle pointer and the new start pointer will be (middle + 1)

- Check if value in the middle pointer > target that way can eliminate all the value after the middle pointer and the new end pointer will be (middle - 1)

If the loop ended and didn't return anything the target is not in the array and we return -1

## Technique

Binary search

## Time Complexity

O(log(n))
