# 274. H-Index

### Problem

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

### Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]

Output: 3

### Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]

Output: 1

## Solution

Sort the array using the build in sort function

Looping through the length of the array recalculating the h-index as the max of the h-index and the min of the citation at that index or the length of the array - the index

return h-index

## Time Complexity
O(n log(n))
