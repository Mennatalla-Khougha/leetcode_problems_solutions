# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

### Problem

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head. 

### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2

Output: [1,2,3,5]

### Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1

Output: []

### Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1

Output: [1]

## Solution

- Loop to get the number or nodes in the linked list then subtract n from it

- If count = 0 and there is a node then remove that node and return the list

- Traverse the list till the node to be deleted the exit the list and delete it

- return the list after deleting
