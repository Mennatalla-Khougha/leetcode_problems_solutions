# 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference

### Problem

You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:

Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.
Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them. 

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2

Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3

Output: []

## Solution

Check the length of the array if the reminder of dividing it by 3 isn't zero return empty array

Sort the array 

Loop through the array each loop check 3 elements and make sure the difference between all three of them is less than or equal K in that case add array of the three elements to the result array else return empty array

Return the result array 

## Time complexity

O(n log n)
