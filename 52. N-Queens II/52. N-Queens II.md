The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

### Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: 2

### Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: 1

## Solution

Initialize 3 sets to keep track of columns and diagonals and result = 0

A backtracking function which take the row number and return when placing a queen in that row in a valid location and increase the result by one

Start the backtracking function at row 0
