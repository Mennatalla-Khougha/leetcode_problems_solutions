# 17.Letter Combinations of a Phone Number

### Problem

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.

#### Example 1:

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

#### Example 2:

Input: digits = ""
Output: []

#### Example 3:

Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a","b","c"]

## Solution

Define a hash map for all the number with every letter

Defining a backtracking function to do generate all possible letter combinations that the number could represent 

- It checks if the length of the combination = the length of the digits if that is the case it append that combination to the result

- It loops over the length of the hashMap values corresponding to the digit appending the letter to the combination then calling the backtrack function with the next digit after the backtrack function return it clean the combination to start fresh

Check if the string is not empty then 
- Start the backtrack function

Return the result 

## Technique

Recursive technique utilizing a hashMap

## Time complexity
