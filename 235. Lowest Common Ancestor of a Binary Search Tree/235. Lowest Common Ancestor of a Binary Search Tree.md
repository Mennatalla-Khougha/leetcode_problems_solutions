# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

### Problem

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

### Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8

Output: 6

### Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4

Output: 2

### Example 3:

Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1

Output: 2

## Solution:

Levering the fact that it's a binary search tree with node.left.val < than node.val and node,right.val > node.val so Looping the root while checking if p, q are < node.val in that case keep checking the left subtree if p, q > node.val keep checking the right subtree else the LCA is the node.val so return it 

## Time Complexity
O(h) h is the height of the binary tree
