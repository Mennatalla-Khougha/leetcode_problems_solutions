# 51. N-Queens

### Problem:

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

### Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

### Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: [["Q"]]

## Solution

Initialize 3 sets to keep track of columns and diagonals 

A backtracking function which take the row number and return when placing a queen in that row in a valid location

Start the backtracking function at row 0

Return the result

## Time Complexity
O(n!)
