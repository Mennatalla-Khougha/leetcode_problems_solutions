# 78. Subsets

### Problem

Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible 
subsets.

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

#### Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

#### Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [[],[0]]

## Solution

Defining a backtracking function to generate all possible unique subsets.

- It checks if the index is bigger than the length of the nums array if that is the case it append a copy of all the subsets into the result

- For every index there is 2 possible subset either adding an empty subset or appending the index to the subset after each one it will call the backtrack function

Start the backtrack function

Return the result
