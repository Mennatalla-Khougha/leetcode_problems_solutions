## Problem

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows. 
And then read line by line.

## Example 1

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

## Example 2

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"

## solution

Loop through the string

Add each character to the result array appropriate row

When at the first row increment the rows by one

When at the last row decrement the rows by one

## Time Complexity

O(N)
