# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Problem

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity. 

### Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0

Output: 4

### Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3

Output: -1

### Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0

Output: -1

## Solution

Defining 2 pointer left and right to define the range to search in the array

A loop with the condition that left pointer is always less than or equal the right pointer

- Calculating the middle pointer 

- Check if the value in the middle pointer = target if that the case we found the index we are looking for

- Checks if the left half of the array is sorted if so check if the target value is between the value in the left pointer and the value in the middle pointer in that case move the eliminate the right half of the array else eliminate the left half of the array

- Checks if the right hale of the array is sorted if so checks if the target is between the value in the middle pointer and the value in the right pointer in that case eliminate the left half of the array else eliminate the right half of the array
