# 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

### Problem

Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).

### Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8

Output: 13

### Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5

## Solution

Loop through the elements of the matrix and transfer it into a 1D array

Sort the 1D array using the build in sort function

return the Kth smallest element
