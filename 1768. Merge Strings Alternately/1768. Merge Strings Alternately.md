# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

### Problem
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

### Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"

Output: "apbqcr"

### Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"

Output: "apbqrs"

### Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"

Output: "apbqcd"

## Solution

- Calculating the length of the bigger string

- Loop through the length checking if the index is in-bound then appending the letters alternately
